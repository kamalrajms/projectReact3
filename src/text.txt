## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.

## structure

## import export
## styleing

    global files
    external files
    module.css files

## props
    
    props is nothing but drilling data from one component
    to another component

        passing data through props variable
        Destructuring of props

## usestate()

    usestate is a react hook that allows you to add state 
    (data that can change over time ) to a functional component.

    normally, in js ,variable disappear after the function runs.
    bur in react with usestate remembers values between re-renders.

    syntax:

        const[state,setState]=usestate(initial value)

        state-current value
        setState-to updating the current value
        initial value-starting value

## conditional rendering & list rendering

    conditional rendering

        conditional rendering means showing or hiding parts of UI
        based on some condition.
